## Projects

- [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles], a collection of Bubbles for the [Bubble Tea][bubbletea] library.
- [charm-in-the-wild][charm-in-the-wild], the best of what the CLI has to offer.

## How can I get involved?

First off, we are quite active on the [Charm Discord](https://charm.sh/chat), so that's a great place to join if you want to hang out with the community futher. Alright, let's talk code.

### Getting featured by the charm community

If you've built a composable element for [Bubble Tea][bubbletea], similar to the
officially supported [Bubbles][bubbles] components. You can open a pull request
in the [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles] repo to get on the list.

If your project falls outside of the scope of a bubble, you can add your project
to the [charm-in-the-wild][charm-in-the-wild] list.  Start by making a PR on
that repository and we'll get you sorted from there!

### Transferring ownership to the charm community

If you would like to have your project housed by the charm community org, then
you can create a [new discussion][new-discussion] where the community can leave
feedback and work to get your project transferred.

> [!NOTE]
> To be featured, projects must meet certain requirements outlined in the repository's README file.
