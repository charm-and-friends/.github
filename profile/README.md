# The power of the community

Welcome to the Charm Community!

A community-led project that is officially backed by the [charmbracelet][charm] organization.

## Our projects

- [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles], a collection of Bubbles for the [Bubble Tea][bubbletea] library.
- [charm-in-the-wild][charm-in-the-wild], the best of what the CLI has to offer.

## How can I get involved?

We are always looking for more libraries, Bubbles, and other awesome projects to include in our collection.

### How can I get my library added?

The first question you should ask is ‚Äúis this better as a bubble?‚Äù If the answer is yes, consider adding it to the [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles].
If you think your project is better suited as a standalone library, then you can make a [new discussion][new-discussion].
From there, the community will leave feedback and help get your project added to the charm-community organization.

### How can I get my plugin/extension added?

If you have an awesome neovim plugin or a cool VSCode extension, then you can make a [new discussion][new-discussion].
From there, the community will leave feedback and help get your project added to the charm-community organization.

### But what if I don't want to transfer ownership?

That‚Äôs totally fine!
You can add your project to the [charm-in-the-wild][charm-in-the-wild] list.

## Feedback

We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this project. Join the chatter happening on [Discord](https://charm.sh/chat).
