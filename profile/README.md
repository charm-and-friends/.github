**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# The power of the community

Welcome to the Charm Community!

A community-led project that is officially backed by [Charm][charm].

</p>

## Our projects

- [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles], a collection of Bubbles for the [Bubble Tea][bubbletea] library.
- [charm-in-the-wild][charm-in-the-wild], the best of what the CLI has to offer.

## How can I get involved?

We are always looking for more libraries, Bubbles, and other glamourous projects
to include in the community collection.

### How can I get my library added?

The first question you should ask is ‚Äúis this better as a bubble?‚Äù If the answer
is yes, consider adding it to the [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles].  If
you think your project is better suited as a standalone library, then you can
make a [new discussion][new-discussion].  From there, the community will leave
feedback and help get your project added to the charm-community organization.

### How can I get my plugin/extension added?

If you have an awesome Neovim plugin or a cool VS Code extension, then you can
make a [new discussion][new-discussion].  From there, the community will leave
feedback and help get your project added to the community org.

### But what if I don't want to transfer ownership?

That‚Äôs totally fine!
You can add your project to the [charm-in-the-wild][charm-in-the-wild] list.

We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this project. Join the chatter happening on [Discord](https://charm.sh/chat).
